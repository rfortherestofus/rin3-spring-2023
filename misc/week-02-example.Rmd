# Bechdel Test

The Bechdel test is a simple test of whether a film has women with agency:

-   Does the movie contain 2 characters who are women

-   Are they named

-   Do they have a conversation about something other than man (or further the plot line of a man)

In this report we'll look at whether it's common to see movies that fail the test.
