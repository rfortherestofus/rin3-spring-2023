# What else can RMarkdown do?

---

## RMarkdown can do a lot...

We've seen that you can make the following:

--

.pull-left[

- HTML reports

- PDF reports

- Word reports

... but there's a lot more.
]

--

.pull-right[

- Beautiful books with `bookdown`

- Beautiful reports with `pagedown`

- Beautiful slides with `xaringan`

- Programmatically generated reports

- Dashboards (... and even shiny apps!)

- Websites all in RMarkdown!

# Books

## Beautiful books with `bookdown`

.pull-left[
The `bookdown` package was used for writing R for Data Science and many other extremely useful R books.

# PDF Reports


---

## Beautiful reports with `pagedown`

.pull-left[
The `pagedown` package is designed to simplify designing documents you need to print.

Instead of learning `LaTeX` you can use HTML and CSS!

---

## `pagedreport`

.pull-left[
R for the Rest of Us has created a package called [`pagedreport`](https://pagedreport.rfortherestofus.com/) that adds several templates to `pagedown`.

## `distill` for websites (and blogs)

Using `distill` is the easiest way to create a fully functioning website with RMarkdown.

# Parameterized reports

## Parameterized reports

Use [parametrized RMarkdown reporting](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html) to make a separate report for each group

# Quarto...

---

### Quarto is the next generation of RMarkdown

.pull-left[

Quarto is a new technology that will be the future of RMarkdown.

> And RMarkdown is **not** going away. RMarkdown will continue to be supported and developed into the future.

### Why does Quarto exist?

.pull-left[

RMarkdown is quite limited in that it's only useful for folks in the R community.

Quarto is designed from the ground up to work for R, Python and Julia users.

### Where to find out more about Quarto

.pull-left[

[Tom Mock](https://twitter.com/thomas_mock) from Posit gave a [great 2h workshop on Quarto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvi5uXQMvu4) we'd recommend.

Actually using Quarto is not much different from RMarkdown

````{verbatim}
---
title: "Untitled"
format: html
---

Everything's the same except:

- We use `format` instead of `output` in the YAML header

- Code chunk options are written differently

```{r}
#| echo: false
rep("lots of cats", 5)
```
````
