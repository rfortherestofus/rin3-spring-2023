# Example Data Viz with `ggtext`

---

## Dumbbell charts and `ggtext`

.pull-left[
Let's walk through building this chart from [Stephanie Evergeen](https://stephanieevergreen.com/easy-dot-plots-in-excel/) in {ggplot2}.

This is a dumbell chart that uses colour in the title in place of a legend. We can do this using {ggtext}

## First, let's wrangle the data

Code the copy from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfortherestofus/rin3-spring-2023/main/misc/stephanie-evergreen-ggtext.R) and wrangle your data into the format needed to make the plot

--

If you have time, start to make the plot

---

## Doing even more with `{ggtext}`

.pull-left[

Our colleague Cara Thompson ran an incredible workshop at NHS-R in November 2022 about leveling up your charts [with {ggtext}].

<br>

You can watch the video and view Cara's slides [on her website](https://www.cararthompson.com/talks/nhsr2022-level-up).

             y = subject,
