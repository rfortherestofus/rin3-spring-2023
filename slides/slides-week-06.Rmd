## Making beautiful tables in Rmd

While there's one package we recommend for charts (`ggplot2`)... the package landscape is more complicated for tables.

David has written a [great blogpost comparing the most widely used packages](https://rfortherestofus.com/2019/11/how-to-make-beautiful-tables-in-r/) and a [chapter in R Without Statistics about tables](https://book.rwithoutstatistics.com/tables-chapter.html).

#### Interactive Tables

- [{DT}](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) is very easy to start with and is somewhat flexible.

- [{reactablefmtr}](https://kcuilla.github.io/reactablefmtr/index.html) extends {reactable} to allow you to build beautiful and highly interactive tables.

#### Printable tables

- [{gt}](https://gt.rstudio.com/) is the most general purpose and flexible solution for making charts. It relies on HTML and CSS.

- [{flextable}](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/index.html) is the solution if you need to output to Word documents. We've also found it useful for tables that need to span multiple pages.

## mutate() and across()

Sometimes you want to do the same thing to many columns.

This can be achieved by combining `mutate()` with `across()`.

---

## Converting many columns at once

```{r}
iris %>% 
  as_tibble()
```

---

## Converting many columns at once

```{r}
iris %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  mutate(across(c(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width), round_half_up))
```

---

## Why are my bars so long?

.pull-left[

```{r eval = FALSE}
msleep %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = vore,
             y = sleep_total)) +
  geom_col()
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r echo = FALSE}
msleep %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = vore,
             y = sleep_total)) +
  geom_col()
```

]

## `theme_ipsum()` issues

Fonts are complicated in R, but have become easier

[New lesson to help you](https://rfortherestofus.com/courses/r-in-3-months-spring-2023/lessons/customize-your-fonts/)

---

## Formatted text in charts

Later in the course we'll introduce the `ggtext` package that will allow us to use HTML in {ggplot2} chart elements.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Penguins are *really cool*")
```

```{r, out.width='300px', echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
           y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Penguins are *really cool*") +
  theme(plot.title = element_markdown())
```

# Git + GitHub

???

---

## A Few Tips for Working with Git and GitHub

--

1. Make sure you're working in a project

--

1. Save files before you commit

--

1. Make sure to select all files you want to commit

---

## Looking at GitHub Repos

[Let's look at the course repo](https://github.com/rfortherestofus/rin3-spring-2023)

---

## Editing files in the browser on GitHub

--

The GitHub website gives you the ability to edit files directly.

--

Technically, this is exactly the same as making a commit.

--

Remember you will need to **pull** the changes onto your local machine.

---

## README

--

When you push a project to GitHub, it will ask if you want to create a README file.

--

The README is a good place to write out instructions for future users (including yourself).

---

## GitHub Desktop

--

The git tab in RStudio is great, it will suit most of your needs.

--

GitHub Desktop provides some additional tools and capabilities that might be useful for more advanced users.

--

If you can't get RStudio and git to work together then consider trying GitHub Desktop instead.

# Next Week
<!-- Charlie's example video was built with this gist https://gist.github.com/charliejhadley/b2bc9af0853779093f1ce7308687ef48 -->

--

1. Advanced data wrangling

--

1. The main thing to make sense of is the concept of tidy data (it's a hard concept, but worth the effort to figure it out!)

--

1. No project assignment next week (but think about how your data is/is not tidy)
